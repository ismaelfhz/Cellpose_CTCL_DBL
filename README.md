# Cellpose_CTCL_DBL
Cellpose model (version 2.2.3) to optimize the segmentation of nuclei of Olfactory Sensory Neurons (OSNs) in Drosophila labeled by fluorescent reporters. The model removes non-specific auto-fluorescent objects from the cuticle (CTCL) scuh as bristles, debris, etc., and splits doublets (DBL) (i.e. two adjacent cells in close proximity) into two individual cells.
